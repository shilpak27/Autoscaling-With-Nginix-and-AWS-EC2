This project focuses on implementing an autoscaling architecture using NGINX and AWS EC2 to enhance the scalability, availability, and performance of web applications. The solution leverages AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on real-time demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency. NGINX is configured as a reverse proxy and load balancer to efficiently distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances. Additionally, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is integrated to maintain high availability and reliability. AWS CloudWatch is utilized for monitoring system performance and triggering scaling events based on predefined thresholds. This approach ensures a fault-tolerant, resilient infrastructure capable of handling varying workloads without manual intervention. The implementation of this autoscaling solution significantly improves system responsiveness, prevents downtime, and optimizes cloud resource management.
